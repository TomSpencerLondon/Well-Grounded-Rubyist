# Regular expressions appear in many programming languages, with minor differences among the incarnations. Their purpose is to specify character patterns that subse- quently are determined to match (or not match) strings. Pattern matching, in turn, serves as the basis for operations like parsing log files, testing keyboard input for valid- ity, and isolating substringsâ€”operations, in other words, of frequent and considerable use to anyone who has to process strings and text.
